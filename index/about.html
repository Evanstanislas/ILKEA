                    <p class="heading">What is ILKEA?</p>
                    <p>ILKEA started as a small furniture shop in Klaten, Central Java in 2010.
                        Despite its humble beginnings, the shop quickly gained popularity for
                         its functional Scandinavian-inspired
                        designs and affordable prices.
                        Within a few years, ILKEA expanded to open its first 
                        large retail store in Jakarta in 2013.
                        The spacious warehouse-style store allowed customers 
                        to browse a wide selection of
                        ILKEA's minimalist and modern furniture. Also this year, 
                        we’re officially called PT. ILKEA Sinar Abadi.
                        Over the next few years, ILKEA established itself as one of the 
                        leading furniture brands in Indonesia.
                        It’s success lead to the first store located in Papua, opened in Merauke in 2017.
                        ILKEA’s newest store opened just in time for 
                        the 13th anniversary of ILKEA, located in Jonggol.</p>
